## Project Description

The main objective of our project is to help normal people learn sign language more efficiently. Learning sign language alone is a difficult task. This project aims to solve the problems that people face while learning it. Typically, learning sign language alone is done with the help of books or tutorials, but it is very time-consuming and inefficient.

The approach we take to solve this problem is by developing software that displays a character or a phrase. The user has to perform the equivalent hand sign in front of the camera. The software will recognize the hand sign made by the user in real-time and convert it into text. This text is then compared to the alphabet or the phrase shown on the screen. If it matches, we proceed to the next one; otherwise, it will show an error message, prompting the user to try again.


## Future Improvements

- Add support for recognizing more complex sign language gestures.
- Improve the accuracy and speed of gesture recognition.
- Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
